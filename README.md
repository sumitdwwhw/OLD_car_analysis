# OLD_car_analysis
This project focuses on analyzing a dataset of used cars to uncover insights into pricing patterns and the factors that influence the resale value of vehicles. The primary goal is to help users—whether buyers, sellers, or analysts—better understand how different features affect a car’s price in the second-hand market.
